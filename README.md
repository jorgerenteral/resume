## Overview
I have been working on frontend since 2014, starting with single page applications driven by jQuery, using underscore and backbone for logic, but since 2015 I started working with Angular (the first version of the framework) and in 2016 I started to work permanently on Angular 2+.

In my experience as a web developer, which I have used to create web, mobile and desktop applications, with a wide range of use cases such as CRM systems, ERP and front-end applications for end users.

Since 2016, I’ve been working with Laravel (PHP) and Express (Node.js) to create REST APIs and microservices, these technologies are the ones that I’m currently mastered at, but I’ve created apps with Next.js (React), MongoDB, Nuxt .js (Vue), in addition to deploying on dedicated Linux servers and virtual servers in services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 or Lambda (serverless).

My goal is to continue developing software that meets the highest standards of modern technologies, create optimal RESTful services and to solve problems intuitively with an optimal user experience.
